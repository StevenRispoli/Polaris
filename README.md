Polaris
=======

Polaris is an inventory management application designed specifically for Stony Brook Medicine's radiology department.
It tracks cleanings, servicings, warranties, locations, and other pertinent information about radiology plates
and cassettes. There are also user accounts with security levels, pop-up alerts, email notifications, and pre-made
queries.

*This was a project I did my senior year at Stony Brook University when I had virtually no development or programming 
experience. It was built between early-March and mid-May 2014. I have published it solely for reference. Since it was 
designed to work on only one, central PC, new registered users have the lowest security level until it is manually 
changed in the database. To experience everything Polaris has to offer, you can either register as a new user and open 
the Polaris.accdb file to change the security level to 4, or log in with the username 'srispoli' and password '4'.*
